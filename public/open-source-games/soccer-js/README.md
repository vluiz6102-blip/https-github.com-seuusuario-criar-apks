# Soccer Engine (soccer-js)

A **retro 2D isometric soccer game engine** written in JavaScript. It simulates full matches with team AI, set pieces, match rules, and optional human control — runnable in the browser or headlessly in Node.js for batch balance testing.

## Features

- **Fixed-timestep match simulation** — logic at 20 UPS, render at 60 FPS; seeded LCG for deterministic AI-only runs
- **Team & player AI** — formations, roles, support spots, pass safety, through balls, marking, counter-press, set-piece playbooks
- **Match rules** — kick-off, goals, throw-ins, corners, free kicks, penalties, offside (delayed), substitutions
- **Isometric canvas rendering** — modular sprites, flags, audio hooks, debug overlays
- **Manual control** — take over a player while AI runs the rest
- **Headless batch runner** — multi-worker simulations, telemetry, parameter sweeps
- **Scenario Lab** — isolated set-piece / open-play situations for interactive testing
- **Asset Manager** — browse and work with sprite / palette assets (game sprites created using [Sprite Editor](https://github.com/haeretici/sprite-editor))

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+ (recommended)
- A modern browser for the UI apps

## Quick start

```bash
# Install build tools (esbuild, sass)
npm install

# Build JS bundle + CSS
npm run build

# Serve the project (static HTTP on port 8080)
npm run dev
```

Then open:

| App | URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| Match Simulator | http://localhost:8080/html/index.html |
| Batch Builder | http://localhost:8080/html/batch-builder.html |
| Simulation Analysis | http://localhost:8080/html/simulation-analysis.html |
| Asset Manager | http://localhost:8080/html/asset-manager.html |
| Scenario Lab | http://localhost:8080/html/tests.html |

Root `index.html` redirects to `html/`, treating a missing trailing slash as a directory so `/prefix` and `/prefix/` both go to `/prefix/html/`.

### Subpath hosting

The UI can be served from a path prefix (e.g. `https://host/soccer/html/index.html`). Static tags in `html/*.html` use `../…`; runtime `fetch` / images use `appUrl()` from `kernel/core/lib/app_paths.js` (detects the parent of `/html/`). Optional override: `window.__APP_ROOT__ = '/soccer/'`.

```

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `npm run build` | Build CSS and browser JS bundle |
| `npm run build:js` / `build:css` | Build only JS or only CSS |
| `npm run dev` | Static server on port 8080 |
| `npm test` | Full test suite (quiet on success) |
| `npm run test:<name>` | Single suite, e.g. `test:pass-safety` |
| `npm run sim:batch` | Headless batch matches |
| `npm run sim:sweep` | Sweep one AI parameter |
| `npm run sim:profile` | Profile a batch run |

Verbose test output:

```bash
VERBOSE=1 npm run test:pass-safety
# or
VERBOSE=1 node tests/pass_safety.js
```

### Headless batch example

```bash
npm run sim:batch -- '{"iterations":10,"seed":42,"headless":true}'
```

Outputs land under `simulations/output/`. For very large runs, prefer `SIMULATION.sh` and run it locally.

### Parameter sweep example

```bash
npm run sim:sweep -- '{"knob":"PASS_AGGRESSION","min":0.1,"max":0.9,"steps":5}'
```

## Determinism

Match bootstrap and logic steps use a **seeded LCG** bound to `Math.random` only during `bootstrapMatch` / `updateAll` (and Scenario Lab apply). Same seed and no human input → same AI match. Manual control, wall-clock scheduling of human input, and non-seeded UI code intentionally diverge after that.

Physics and AI knobs live in `kernel/settings.js` (`Settings.physics`, `Settings.AI`) so balance tweaks stay in one place.
